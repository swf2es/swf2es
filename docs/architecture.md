# Architecture

swf2es plays SWF files in the browser and compiles their bytecode to
JavaScript. It has one compiler, which runs at two different times:

- **JIT**: the browser player runs `@swf2es/codegen` when a SWF loads. Each
  method is compiled on its first call, in a worker pool, off the main thread.
- **AOT**: node (or a server) runs the same compiler ahead of time and caches
  the result.

The compiler is written in AssemblyScript and ships as `codegen.wasm`, with
a thin TypeScript wrapper. The one wasm binary runs in browser workers, in
node, and in any server-side wasm runtime (for example wazero in a Go
server), so there is only one implementation to keep correct.

## The JIT/AOT invariant

For the same input, both modes must produce byte-identical output. That
requires:

1. **Compilation is pure.** `format` and `codegen` use no DOM or node APIs, no
   clock and no randomness. Their tsconfigs load no DOM or node types, so the
   build rejects such code, and a unit test fails if `codegen.wasm` imports
   anything besides `env.abort`.
2. **The unit of translation is one method.** A method's output depends only on
   its ABC, never on which other methods were compiled before it.
3. **Both modes use the same facts.** Optimizations use only what the ABC being
   compiled proves (final classes, sealed traits, typed slots). Anything that
   can change at runtime, such as a child SWF redefining a class, gets a
   runtime guard in both modes.
4. **Shared cache key.** Output is keyed by ABC hash plus `COMPILER_VERSION`
   (`cacheKey()` in codegen), so the browser cache, AOT output served by a
   server, and JIT output are interchangeable.

CI compiles every conformance test in both modes and fails if the output
hashes differ.

## Packages

| Package   | Responsibility                                                  | May depend on             |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `format`  | SWF container and tags, ABC, AVM1 action records                | —                         |
| `codegen` | bytecode → IR → ES modules, in AssemblyScript (`assembly/`)     | format                    |
| `runtime` | AS3/AS2 language semantics called by generated code             | —                         |
| `player`  | display list, timeline, playerglobal, AVM1 globals, renderers   | format, codegen, runtime  |
| `cli`     | ahead-of-time compiler command                                  | format, codegen           |

`runtime` contains only the language, with no display list, so it runs in node
next to avmshell. `codegen` knows the runtime's function names and signatures
but never imports its implementation. pnpm only links the packages each
`package.json` lists, so the build rejects undeclared imports, and
`tests/unit/boundaries.test.ts` checks the declarations and the tsconfigs.

## Parsing, linking and verifying

avmplus checks an ABC in three places, and swf2es checks it in the same
three, with the same VerifyError numbers:

1. **Parsing** (`codegen/assembly/abc`): everything avmplus rejects while
   parsing that one ABC can decide on its own: counts, pool indices, trait
   kinds and names, class order, a method bound to two owners.
2. **Linking**, when classes are defined: anything that needs classes from
   other ABCs or playerglobal, such as base classes, interfaces, overrides
   and name clashes.
   The ABCs loaded together form a domain (`codegen/assembly/link`), which
   interns strings and namespaces across them and finds script definitions
   by qualified name. Builtin ABCs mark their namespace URIs with the API
   version that introduced a name; as in avmplus, user code sees the names
   of its own version and series (Flash Player's by default), so AIR-only
   and VM-internal names stay hidden. While an ABC loads, its classes link
   to base classes and interfaces defined by earlier ABCs' scripts or by
   its own earlier classes, as avmplus' `AbcParser` links them.
3. **Verifying a method**, when it is first compiled: its signature's types
   and its bytecode.

An ABC with errors in more than one stage may report a different first
error than avmshell. Well-formed ABCs are unaffected.

## Compiling a method

Each method goes through the same steps, in `codegen`:

1. **Decode** (`abc/code.ts`): the reachable instructions, as the avmplus
   verifier reads them.
2. **Verify and build the IR** in one pass, as avmplus' `Verifier` does its
   checks: a frame state per block (operand stack, scope stack, locals and
   their types), merged where control flow joins, with avmplus' VerifyError
   numbers. The same pass writes the IR, so what is compiled is exactly what
   was verified.
   Where avmplus changed after the oracle's avmshell was built, swf2es
   follows the newer Flash Player: since PSIRT 3037, a method that can
   throw into a handler needs `max_stack` of at least 1, which the
   oracle's avmshell does not check.
3. **The IR** is register form with types, not SSA. Stack slot *d* becomes
   register `s_d` and locals stay `l_n`, so `getlocal1; getlocal2; add;
   setlocal3` is `l3 = add(l1, l2)`. Every register has the verifier's type
   (`int`, `uint`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `String`, a class, `null`, `*`),
   which is what typed lowering needs: `add` then `convert_i` on two `int`s is
   `(a + b) | 0`, a typed slot on a known class is a direct field access. V8
   does SSA-level optimization on the JavaScript anyway. The IR is flat
   tables, like the parser's: instruction rows (op, destination, sources,
   immediate, type) and block rows (range, successors), reused across methods.
4. **Control flow.** First a per-method dispatcher
   (`for (;;) switch (block) { ... }`), which handles any control flow,
   irreducible or obfuscated included. Then structured JavaScript (loops, `if`,
   labelled `break`) from the dominator tree for the reducible code compilers
   emit, falling back to the dispatcher. Conformance tests check that both
   give the same results.
5. **Emission** writes JavaScript as UTF-8 into a growable byte buffer: no
   JavaScript strings, and names are copied straight from the ABC.

### The runtime and the standard library

Generated code calls `@swf2es/runtime` for the object model, multiname
lookup, coercions and exceptions; it grows as far as each step needs.

avmplus' standard library (`Object`, `Array`, `String`, `Math`, `Date`,
`RegExp`, `JSON`, `Vector`, `ByteArray` and so on) is mostly AS3 compiled
into `builtin.abc`; only its `native` methods are C++. swf2es compiles
`builtin.abc` itself and implements the natives in TypeScript, matched by
class and method name as avmplus matches its C++ ones. The standard library
never changes for a compiler version, so it is compiled once at build time
and shipped precompiled next to the runtime, keyed by its hash like any ABC.
Its AS3 sources are MPL-2.0: the compiled library stays MPL, in its own
package, with its source available. `playerglobal` (`flash.*`) is declarations
only, so the player implements all of it.

## Testing against oracles

- **avmshell** (avmplus/Tamarin shell) for AS3 semantics: the output of the
  compiled test must match avmshell's `trace()` output exactly. The Tamarin
  acceptance suite supplies thousands of cases.
- **Flash Player debug projector** for playerglobal behaviour, captured into
  a separate corpus repo. Only redistributable SWFs go there.

## Milestone 1

The as3pb protobuf benchmark (`tests/programs`), compiled by swf2es and run in node:

- its trace output matches avmshell byte for byte;
- it is faster than the AwayFL JIT on the same benchmark (ByteArray 574 ms,
  domain memory 728 ms headless; PepperFlash 188 ms / 83 ms);
- the Tamarin `ecma3/` and `as3/Types/` suites run through the conformance
  runner, with their pass rate tracked.

Out of scope for milestone 1: E4X, `Proxy`, `with`, playerglobal, SWF
timelines.
